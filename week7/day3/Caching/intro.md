# What is Caching?
Caching is a technique used to store a copy of a given resource (like a web page, database query result, or any data) in a temporary storage area, so that future requests for that resource can be served faster.

## Why Use Caching?
* **Performance Improvement:** Caching reduces the time it takes to fetch data. Instead of querying the database every time, the application can retrieve data from the cache, which is much faster.
* **Reduced Database Load:** By serving cached data, you reduce the number of queries hitting your database. This can help in scaling your application, especially under high traffic.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Reducing database queries can also lower costs if you're using cloud services that charge based on the number of queries.

## How Caching Works
When a request is made to your application:

* **Check Cache:** The application first checks if the requested data is available in the cache.
* **Serve from Cache:** If the data is found in the cache (a cache hit), it is returned immediately.
* **Fetch from Database:** If the data is not found in the cache (a cache miss), the application fetches it from the database, stores it in the cache for future requests, and then returns the data.

### Example Scenario
Imagine you have a web application that displays user profiles. Without caching, every time a user visits a profile, the application queries the database to fetch the user's data. If many users are accessing the same profile, this can lead to a lot of unnecessary database queries.

With caching, the first request fetches the data from the database and stores it in the cache. Subsequent requests for the same profile can be served directly from the cache, significantly speeding up response times.
