# Class-Based Views

Class-Based Views (CBVs) in Django provide a more object-oriented approach to handling views compared to Function-Based Views (FBVs). They allow for better organization, reuse, and extensibility of code. CBVs encapsulate the logic of a view in a class, making it easier to manage complex views.

Instead of defining a function for each view, you define a Python class. This class typically maps HTTP request methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding methods within the class. For example, a GET request will automatically be handled by a get() method, and a POST request by a post() method. This mapping is managed by an internal dispatch() method.


## Benefits of Class-Based Views
* ### Reusability: 
CBVs promote code reuse through inheritance. You can create a base view class and extend it for specific views.
* ### Organization: 
Grouping related functionality into a single class makes the codebase cleaner and easier to navigate.
* ### Mixins: 
CBVs support mixins, which allow you to add specific functionality to views without modifying the base class.
* ### Built-in Generic Views: 
Django provides a set of built-in generic views that handle common tasks, reducing the amount of code you need to write.
