# At its core, a set in Python is a built-in data type that
# represents an unordered collection of unique (non-duplicate) elements.
# It's fundamentally based on the mathematical concept of a set.
# In Python, sets are mutable, unindexed and do not contain duplicates.
# The order of elements in a set is not preserved and can change.

# 1. Unordered:
#  At its core, a set in Python is a built-in data type that
#  represents an unordered collection of unique (non-duplicate) elements.
# The order in which elements are printed or iterated over (e.g., in a for loop) is not guaranteed
# and may vary across Python runs or versions, although in practice,
# it often seems consistent for smaller sets in a single run.

# 2. Unindexed:
# Sets do not support indexing. Trying to access an element by index (set[0]) raises a TypeError.
# print(my_set[0]) # This would cause a TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

# 3. Mutability:
# We can add elements to the set using add().
# We can remove elements from the set using remove().
# The set changes after these operations, demonstrating its mutability.
