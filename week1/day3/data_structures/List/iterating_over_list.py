#  Iterating over lists is useful when we want to do some operation on each item
#  or access specific items based on certain conditions.

# example to iterate over the list using for loop.
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
# Iterating over the list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#Output:
#apple
#banana
#cherry
