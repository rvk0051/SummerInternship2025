#Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
#The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function
#so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs,
#we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

#Some Benefits of Using Functions:-
# 1. Increase Code Readability
# 2. Increase Code Reusability

#Syntax:
# def function_name(parameters)
      #statement
      #return expression
#def and return are keywords


#Types of functions:-
# 1. Built-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use.
# 2. User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.
