# Naming Rules for Python
#1. Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
#2. A variable name cannot start with a digit.
#3. Variable names are case-sensitive (abc and aBc are different).
#4. Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.

age=21
_color= 'Blue'
total_123='6'

 #Here, all 3 variables defined above are valid

Total_123='9'

# total_123 and Tota;_123 are different variables

# Let's see some examples of invalid variables
# 1name='abc' # invalid as it starts with a digit
# class = 10 # invalid as class is a reserved keyword
# user-name ="Doe" # invalid as it contains hyphen
