#In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution.
# A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value.
# Unlike many other programming languages, Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type.
# The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

#Variables act as placeholders for data.
# They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.

number=10
string1="Hello"

# Here, number and string1 are variables

print(number)
print(string1)
