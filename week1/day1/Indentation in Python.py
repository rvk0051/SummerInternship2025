# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

#Example:-
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

#Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
#if 5 > 2:
#print("Five is greater than two!") #This shows error

#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")

#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give an error
