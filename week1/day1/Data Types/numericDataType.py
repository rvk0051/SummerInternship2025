# A numeric value can be an integer, a floating number, or even a complex number.

#Integers

a = 5
print(type(a)) # <class 'int'>

#Float

# Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer
# may be appended to specify scientific notation.
b = 5.0
print(type(b)) # <class 'float'>

#Complex Numbers
#It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j . For example - 2+3j
c = 2 + 4j
print(type(c)) # <class 'complex'>
