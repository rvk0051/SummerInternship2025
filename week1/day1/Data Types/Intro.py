#Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
# It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
# Since everything is an object in Python programming,
# Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.
# The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:

#Numeric - int, float, complex
#Sequence Type - string, list, tuple
#Mapping Type - dict
#Boolean - bool
#Set Type - set, frozenset
#Binary Types - bytes, bytearray, memoryview

#Example:-
number1 = 50 #int
number2 = 60.5 #float
x = "Hello World" #string
list1 = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"] #list
set1 = {"geeks", "for", "geeks"} #set
