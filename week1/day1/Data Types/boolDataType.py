#Python Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.
#Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false).
#However non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in a Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false.

print(type(True)) #Output:- <class 'bool'>
print(type(False)) #Output:- <class 'bool'>

# print(type(true))
# shows error as true is not a valid keyword in Python.
# Python is case-sensitive.
