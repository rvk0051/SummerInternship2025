#In Python, lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data.
# It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

# Creating a Python list with different data types
a = [10, 20, "Hello", 40, True]

print(a)

# Accessing elements using indexing
print(a[0])  # 10
print(a[1])  # 20
print(a[2])  # "Hello"
print(a[3])  # 40
print(a[4])  # True
