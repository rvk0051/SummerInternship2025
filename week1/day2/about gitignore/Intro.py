#The .gitignore file tells Git which files and folders to ignore (not track).

#This is useful for keeping log files, temporary files, build artifacts, or personal files out of your repository.

#Examples of files to ignore: log files, temporary files, hidden files, personal files, OS/editor files, etc.
#The .gitignore file itself is tracked by Git, so everyone using the repository ignores the same files.


#When to Use .gitignore :-
# 1. When you want to keep sensitive, local, or unnecessary files out of your repository
# 2. When sharing a project with others and want to avoid cluttering Git history
# 3. When working with build tools or editors that create extra files
