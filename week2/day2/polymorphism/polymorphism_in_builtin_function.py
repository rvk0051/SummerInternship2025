'''
Polymorphism in built-in functions:-

Python's built-in functions exhibit polymorphism, adapting to various data types.
Python determines behavior at runtime,
enabling these functions to work across diverse types without explicit type declarations.

#Example:-

#Output:- 5

print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # List length
# Output:- 3
