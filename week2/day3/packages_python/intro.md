**Packages in Python:-**

* A package is a way of organizing related Python modules (files with .py extension) in a directory hierarchy.

* Think of a package as a folder that contains .py files (modules) and an optional __init__.py file.

* It helps in modular programming and code reuse.

* Packages in Python extend the concept of the modular approach further.
