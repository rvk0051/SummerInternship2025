# Key Differences Between Project and App

* ### Scope:
1. A project is a collection of configurations and apps that make up a complete web application.
2. An app is a smaller, self-contained module that performs a specific function within the project.

* ### Reusability:
1. A project is typically unique to a specific application.
2. An app can be reused across different projects. For example, you could use the same authentication app in multiple projects.

* ### Structure:
1. A project contains settings, URLs, and configurations for the entire application.
2. An app contains models, views, and other components that are specific to that app's functionality.
