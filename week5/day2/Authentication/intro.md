# Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client (user, application, or service) making a request to your API.

It asks 'Who are you?' The process of verifying credentials and identifying the client.
Example: A user provides a username and password (or a token), and the system confirms their identity.

In the context of APIs, authentication is paramount for several reasons:

* **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.
* **Access Control:** Enables the API to determine what resources a particular client is allowed to access or modify.
* **Auditing:** Allows for logging and tracking of actions performed by authenticated clients.
* **Personalization:** Delivers customized responses based on the authenticated client's identity.
