# Types of Routers in DRF:-
DRF provides two primary Router classes, with DefaultRouter being the most commonly recommended choice for its additional features.

## 1. rest_framework.routers.SimpleRouter:-
* This is the most basic router. It generates URL patterns for ModelViewSet (and GenericViewSet with appropriate mixins) to cover the standard collection (list/create) and detail (retrieve/update/delete) actions.
* #### Generated URL Patterns:
1. /{prefix}/ for list and create actions.
2. /{prefix}/{lookup}/ for retrieve, update, and destroy actions.

* Does not provide a browsable API root view.
* Does not generate URL patterns for format suffixes (e.g., .json, .xml).
* Suitable when you only need basic URL generation and prefer to implement your own API root or do not require format suffixes.

## 2. rest_framework.routers.DefaultRouter:-
* This router inherits from SimpleRouter and extends its functionality.
* #### Generated URL Patterns:
1. All patterns generated by SimpleRouter.
2. An API root view that lists all registered endpoints.
3. Additional URL patterns for format suffixes, allowing clients to request specific data formats (e.g., /users.json, /users/1.api).
*  Accessing the base URL registered with the router (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/) displays a list of all resources.
*  Generates URL patterns for format suffixes.
