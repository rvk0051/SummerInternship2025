# Testing APIs
Testing your API is a crucial step in the development process. It ensures that your endpoints are functioning as expected and that they handle various scenarios correctly.

## Importance of testing APIs:-
### 1. Verify Functionality: 
Ensure that your API endpoints return the expected responses for various requests.

### 2. Catch Bugs Early: 
Identify issues before they reach production, reducing the risk of errors in your application.

### 3. Document API Behavior: 
Testing helps document how your API is expected to behave, which is useful for both developers and users.

### 4. Performance Testing: 
Assess how your API performs under different loads and conditions.
