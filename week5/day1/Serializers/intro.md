# Serializers in DRF
A Serializer is a core DRF component used to:
* Convert complex data types (like Django model instances) into native Python data types.
* These can then be rendered into JSON, XML, etc. (for APIs).
* Also converts incoming JSON (from API requests) into validated Python data (and optionally saves them to the database).

Objects in the Django REST Framework must be serialized into data types that front-end frameworks and javascript can comprehend. Following the initial validation of the incoming data, serializers also offer deserialization, enabling the conversion of parsed data back into complicated types. The REST framework's serializers operate quite similarly to Django's Form and ModelForm classes. 

Through the use of serializers, complicated data, such as querysets and model instances, can be transformed into JSON, XML, or other content kinds with ease using native Python datatypes. Following the initial validation of the incoming data, serializers also offer deserialization, enabling the conversion of parsed data back into complicated types.
