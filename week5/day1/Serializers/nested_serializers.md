# Nested Serializers in Django
Nested serialization in Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful feature that allows you to represent complex data structures, where one model is related to another, in a single API response. This is particularly useful when you have relationships such as one-to-many or many-to-many between your models.

## Why Use Nested Serialization?
#### * Data Representation: 
It allows you to represent related data in a more intuitive way, making it easier for clients to consume the API.
#### * Reduced API Calls: 
By including related data in a single response, you can reduce the number of API calls needed to fetch related information.
#### * Improved Readability: 
It makes the API responses more readable and structured, which is beneficial for developers consuming the API.

## Example:-
lwt us assume the following models.py:-
```aiignore
from django.db import models
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, related_name='books', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

then, the corresponding serializers are:-
```aiignore
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Author, Book
class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # This serializer handles the serialization of the Book model. It includes the id and title fields.
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['id', 'title']
        
class AuthorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # This serializer handles the serialization of the Author model. It includes a nested representation of the books field, which uses the BookSerializer. The many=True argument indicates that an author can have multiple books.
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)  # Nested serializer
    class Meta:
        model = Author
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'books']

```
